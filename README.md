## Inspiration

Schools and their students were hit particularly hard by the pandemic and while efforts were made to make sure that our education could continue amid the Coronavirus, many aspects of school (particularly the fun ones) were lost.

Clubs have been big parts of our high school careers, so naturally we hoped that they could continue. However, this was easier said than done. Finding new members was never easy and keeping track of meeting dates and times across different clubs was a headache.

XRoads, named after our schoolâ€™s central meeting spot, crossroads, is a platform to connect clubs and extracurriculars with current and prospective members. It aims to address the problems that were worsened by COVID-19 while remaining useful well after we return to in-person education.

## What is XRoads
XRoads allows students to connect with clubs that they may have not been exposed to otherwise. Students can explore clubs at their school, learn more about them, see upcoming events and get in touch. The easy to use editor allows club leaders to create a highly customized page for prospective members. The access-code based edit system allows for easy set up for schools and programming-inclined students.
